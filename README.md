# LRSGen 

### LRSGen is a small software project written on top of Wordpress.

This software package has no actual real world aspirations, but is currently a go-to concept when it comes to learning and implementing new languages and technologies.
This current implementation implements large amounts of AJAX, and integrates new concepts that were previously mothballed due to not knowing how to built them.

This project makes use of extensive Object-oriented PHP principles, a ton of AJAX, and Object oriented CSS.
It also strives to keep things cohesive, DRY-er than an oaky merlot, and simpler than Gene Simmons's band.
